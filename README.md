My main issue was that "this.children" didn't work for some reason - the console didn't recognize it even when I did console.log. Therefore, I decided to create functions and event listeners for each submenu. I'm not sure if it's the most efficient way to solve the problem, but it still worked while this.children didn't. 

I also had issues with the CSS transition and the way you demoed it didn't work on my end, so I went on StackOverflow and realized I had to use opacity instead of display.
